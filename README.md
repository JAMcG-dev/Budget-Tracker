Budget Tracker App
This is a simple Budget Tracker web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to manage their finances by tracking their income and expenses. It displays a summary of total income, total expenses, and balance. Transactions are saved using localStorage so the data persists even after page reloads.

Features:
Add income and expense transactions with descriptions and amounts.
View a list of all transactions, categorized by income and expenses.
Automatically update and display the total income, total expenses, and overall balance.
Transactions are stored in localStorage so the data is persistent across page reloads.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Used to structure the content of the application.
CSS: Used to style the application and make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used to add interactivity, handle form submissions, and calculate totals.
localStorage: Used to store transaction data so it persists even after the page is refreshed.
How to Use:
Open the Application:

Simply open the index.html file in your browser to launch the Budget Tracker app.
Add a Transaction:

Enter a Description (e.g., "Salary", "Groceries").
Enter an Amount (the value of the transaction).
Select the Type (Income or Expense).
Click the "Add Transaction" button to add it to the list.
View Summary:

The app will automatically update the Total Income, Total Expenses, and Balance based on the transactions you add.
Persistence:

Your transactions will be saved in the browser's localStorage. Even if you refresh the page, the data will remain intact.
Example:
Add Income:

Description: "Salary"
Amount: "$2000"
Type: "Income"
Add Expense:

Description: "Groceries"
Amount: "$150"
Type: "Expense"
After adding these transactions, your summary might look like this:

Total Income: $2000
Total Expenses: $150
Balance: $1850

How to Add More Features:
This app is a great starting point for further development. Here are a few suggestions for enhancements:

Transaction Deletion: Add a delete button next to each transaction to remove it.
Currency Formatting: Use JavaScript’s Intl.NumberFormat or a library like accounting.js to format numbers as currency (e.g., $1,000.00).
Charts: Integrate Chart.js to display your income vs. expenses visually.
Responsive Design: Make sure the app is mobile-friendly using CSS media queries or a framework like Bootstrap.
Additional Notes:
Persistence: The app relies on localStorage to save data. If a user clears their browser history or data, the transactions will be lost.
Browser Compatibility: This app works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
